// Check for specific error types
if (errorMessage.includes('uploaded successfully')) {
  toast.warning(`Member created successfully, but some files failed to upload. ${errorMessage}`);
} else if (errorMessage.includes('At least one file is required')) {
  toast.error('No files were selected for upload. Please select at least one file.');
} else if (errorMessage.includes('File size exceeds')) {
  toast.error('Upload failed: One or more files exceed the 10MB size limit. Please check your files and try again.');
}
// ... more specific error handling
```

### **User-Friendly Error Messages**
Raw error messages are transformed into user-friendly versions:

```typescript
// Raw error: "File size exceeds 10MB limit"
// User-friendly: "File size exceeds 10MB limit. Please choose a smaller file."

// Raw error: "File type not allowed. Only PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, DOC, DOCX files are accepted"
// User-friendly: "File type not supported. Please use PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, DOC, or DOCX files."
```
